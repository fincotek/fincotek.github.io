      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Product Authenticity</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key features of Fincotek platform is the product authenticity
        verification system. This system will allow consumers to verify the
        authenticity of the products they purchase by scanning a QR code on the
        product packaging. The QR code will be linked to a blockchain record
        that verifies the authenticity of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authenticity verification system will help to reduce the incidence
        of counterfeit products, protect the reputation of businesses, and
        provide consumers with greater confidence in the products they purchase
        online. By creating an immutable record of the authenticity of each
        product, businesses can also reduce the risk of legal liability for
        selling counterfeit products.
      </p>
